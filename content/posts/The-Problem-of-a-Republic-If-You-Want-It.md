# The Problem of A Republic—If You Want It

> Wisdom serving prudence. Forming consciences by exploring the moral tradition of the Catholic Church, its timeless sources, and by speaking simply to individual people.

![gadsden-flag](http://ethikapolitika.org/wp-content/uploads/gadsden-flag-300x199.jpg)Why is it so hard to talk about limiting pornography amongst an American audience, especially among conservatives? In [yesterday's article](http://ethikapolitika.org/2013/08/06/pornography-self-government-and-the-res-publica/), Aaron Taylor hit two key points. The first comes from a knee-jerk reaction that American conservatives seem to have toward laws that potentially restrict speech:  

> It is not a case, Cooke argues, of defending rape porn or indeed any kind of porn, but of defending “the liberty of consenting adults,” and the “spectacularly successful Internet,” whose success is based on the fact that it is “unregulated, decentralized, and ultimately backed up by the American First Amendment.”

Pornography is, on some level, speech and the government therefore ought to be very cautious towards any movements that would potentially restrict that speech. Mr. Taylor attributes—rightly so—these attitudes of a libertarian sense protecting freedoms. That is, as Mr. Taylor points out, every society has struggled with some restrictions on indecent materials. Nevertheless, Mr. Taylor is a bit soft. We really shouldn't accept, even for the sake of argument, that pornography is actually speech. It isn't. Perversions of something aren't the thing itself. Even four-year-olds get this. If one four-year-old makes fun of another four-year-old for being funny looking, no one would call that "friendship" or "interaction." Speech is meant to communicate ideas—and its liberty in society serves a purpose—so, uncritically accepting pornography as speech does a disservice.

Of course, treating pornography as speech shows nothing but a lack of imagination. Mr. Taylor's second point precisely plays off of this problem and castigates the libertarian slouching the American political order towards monarchy:  

> In a properly constituted republic – precisely because government is something that we as a people do to ourselves – laws cannot be envisaged as an imposition by the state on the body politic, as if the government were merely an external force. Ironically, the libertarian, who insists on seeing the citizen as merely a subject of an overbearing state instead of a participant in the political community, actually reverts to classical monarchism in its most base form.

For the vast majority of conservatives—libertarian and conservative alike—there is little difference between "law" and "coercion." With an increasingly criminalized state and a militarized police force, it's not hard to accept, at least superficially, the idea that the law is coercion. Nevertheless, for the vast majority of interactions on a daily level, we don't really have the fear of going to jail or being deprived of property motivating us to follow the law. Americans do it out of habit, and a habit freely chosen and deliberately cultivated in our society. Such freely chosen habit can never be the result of coercive action.

But why should it matter? As Mr. Taylor thinks it: everything. Without a political imagination that embraces the need for true self-governance, all we are left with is simple power politics. Cameron's campaign against pornography rather than being a nanny-state overreach is a last-cry of a society trying desperately to recover some sense of dignity in self-governance. But will people actually want to argue that position? The cynic in me says no. But crazier things have happened.
